The Internet is a massive, global system of interconnected computer networks,
a "network of networks" using TCP/IP protocols to link
private, public, academic, and government networks worldwide,
enabling instant communication, information sharing (Web, email, streaming),
and vast services like e-commerce, social media, and entertainment,
transforming how people live, work, and learn.
It works by transmitting data in packets across physical (cables, fiber optics)
and wireless (Wi-Fi, cellular) connections, accessible through Internet Service Providers (ISPs).
Key Aspects of the Internet:
Global Connectivity: Links billions of devices (computers, phones, etc.) across the planet.
Decentralized: No single entity owns or controls it; thousands of organizations manage interconnected networks.
Information Hub: Hosts services like the World Wide Web (websites), email, file sharing, video calls, and more.
Communication Backbone: Facilitates instant messaging, forums, and social networking.
Foundation for Modern Life: Drives e-commerce, digital media, online education, and global business.
